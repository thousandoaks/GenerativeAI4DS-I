The battery life seems to be pretty impressive so far.

I wish the head was bigger with different length bristles to get between teeth better because this one doesn\\u2019t. \\n  Overall if you can get this one around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can get generic ones that're more reasonably priced.   This toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist every day.
