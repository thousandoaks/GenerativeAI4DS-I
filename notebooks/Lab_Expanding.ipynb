The string to the lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products \",\n          \"\\nSo, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of November, about half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base,the part where the blade locks into place doesn\\u2019t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy).  Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise.  I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days\",\n          \"\\nGot this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's a bit small for what I paid though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to her.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The string to the lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products \",\n          \"\\nSo, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of November, about half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base,the part where the blade locks into place doesn\\u2019t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy).  Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise.  I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days\",\n          \"\\nGot this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's a bit small for what I paid though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to her.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"SentimentAndResponses\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
